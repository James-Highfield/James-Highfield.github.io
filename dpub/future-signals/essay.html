        <h1>Peter Gran, Beyond Eurocentrism: A New View of Modem World History. Syracuse (Syracuse University Press) 1996. 440 pp. ISBN 0-8156-2692-4.</h1>

        <p>
          Peter Gran, Associate Professor of History at Temple University, asks himself why world history is not looked at in terms of social history when nearly all other subjects are. Why is it still studied in terms of mainly Western elite groups? How can one get this newer logic of social history into this field? How can one get beyond Eurocentrism? In answering these questions, he goes back to Michael Foucault and Antonio Gramsci. Like Foucault he accepts that power is not only in the hands of an elite but diffused throughout society. According to this view one must put aside an elite-mass type of analysis. In the study of world history there is not just one single power centre, defined geographically and located in Western countries (Eurocentrism). As Gramsci, Gran is a critic of presentism and linearism. The future is as an open book and not determined by the past. There is not, as many world historians want us to believe, only one European way for the future.

        <p>
          Europe has always been diverse in the sense that the elite groups in the various countries have used different strategies in rising to hegemony. They have followed different roads in disguising class conflict, of which equivalents can be found all over the world. It is thus impossible to say beforehand which road is the most effective in letting a large part of the population (the prerequisite for successful hegemony) have an interest in the continuation of a dominant set of ideas and practices. Gran identifies four of these roads.
        </p>

        <p>
          The first is the 'Russian Road'. Its main characteristic is that the ruling class disguises class conflict through rule by caste. The second is the 'Italian Road'. Here the leading class, to disguise class conflict in the country as a whole, plays off the population of one region against the other. The third road is the 'tribal-ethnic road'. Tribal-ethnic differences are used to disguise class conflict. The last is the road of 'bourgeois democracy'. According to Grant, in such a system class conflict is disguised through maintaining a permanent racial undercaste.
        </p>

        <p>
          By giving legal rights to some individuals of the undercaste, the idea of their inclusion within the white masses is upheld, but cultural and bureaucratic procedures are used to exclude the racial undercaste as a whole. Reading the book, you could yourself ask why Gran identifies only four 'Roads'. Why not a Scandinavian or a Dutch one? I think that here lies the reason why Grant analyses thoroughly the political economies of the countries under study. He is not unaware of the differences between them, but they are like roads. They go from A to B, not in a perfect line but with twists and turns. These twists and turns he divides in three phases: a 'liberal' phase, followed by a 'corporate' phase, in turn followed by a 'neo-liberal' phase. Is his classification an alternative for world historians? Maybe there are different roads to hegemony indeed, but is it not a classification a la Aristode? Would it then not be more logical to find more or less the same 'Roads' all over die world? At one-point Gran is certainly right, that is when he states that not only Western elite groups count. The masses around the world have an influence, including those in the countryside in the periphery.
        </p>

        <p>
          Power is always reciprocal. So elite groups must always be aware that they cannot go too far in abusing their position of power. To stay in power for a longer time they must buy off the 'complaints' of the masses. Although the power of 'the West' is not a logical consequence of a thousand years of history, Western elite groups are the most powerful. It is then only logical to explain world history of die last four hundred years in terms of Western elite groups: because of their power they set the rules of the game more than, for example, poor farmers in Niger do. This does not mean that we do not have to look for alternative analyses of world history. Many of us are a product of Western dominance, and therefore we often forget that there can be different lines of thought. The book of Peter Gran then is a very impressive tour de force in leaving behind this dominant theory. It shall certainly contribute to the formulation of new world history theories.
